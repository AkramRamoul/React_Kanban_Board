# Kanban Board Application
This repository contains a Kanban board application built with React, utilizing the @dnd-kit library for drag-and-drop functionality. The app allows users to create, organize, and manage tasks across multiple columns, providing a simple yet effective tool for project management.

# Features:

Dynamic Columns and Tasks: Easily add, rename, and delete columns and tasks.

Drag-and-Drop Interface: Seamlessly move tasks between columns and reorder them within the same column.

Persistent Storage: Tasks and columns are saved locally using custom hooks for localStorage, ensuring data persists across sessions.

This project is deployed via GitHub Pages. Check out the live demo [here](https://akramramoul.github.io/React_Kanban_Board/).
